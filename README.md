# Symphony of One MCP - Multi-Agent Orchestration System

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables multiple Claude instances to collaborate through a centralized hub with shared workspace and real-time communication.

## Architecture

```
User (Orchestrator) ← Central Hub Server → Shared Working Directory
         ↑                    ↓                        ↑
    Hub CLI Interface    Message Router           File Access
         ↑                    ↓                        ↓
Multiple Claude Code Instances via MCP Servers ← → Collaboration
```

## Components

### 1. Central Hub Server (`server.js`)

- Express + Socket.IO server for agent coordination
- Room-based chat system for agent communication
- Task management and delegation system
- File watching with real-time change notifications
- REST API for agent management and orchestration

### 2. User Orchestrator CLI (`cli.js`)

- Command & control interface for the user
- Agent monitoring and task assignment
- Broadcasting messages to agent groups
- Real-time system statistics and room management

### 3. Claude Agent MCP Server (`mcp-server.js`)

- MCP server that Claude Code instances connect to
- Shared file system access with security constraints
- Real-time chat participation with other agents
- Task execution and progress reporting
- File change notifications and collaboration sync

## Quick Start

### 1. Automated Setup

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:

- Install all dependencies (including sqlite3)
- Create the shared workspace directory
- Test the MCP server
- Show Claude Desktop configuration instructions

> 🆕 **New in v2.0**: Enhanced CLI with role management, task templates, and tab completion!

### 2. Start the Central Hub

```bash
npm run server
```

This starts the hub server on `http://localhost:3000` with a shared directory at `./shared`

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

#### **🎯 Automatic Configuration (Recommended)**

Generate the correct configuration for your environment:

```bash
npm run config
```

This creates:

- `claude-config-windows.json` - For Claude Desktop (Windows)
- `claude-config-wsl.json` - For Claude Code (WSL)

**Note:** The examples below show placeholder paths. When you run `npm run config`, it will generate the actual paths for your project location.

#### **📋 Manual Configuration**

Add the appropriate configuration to your Claude Desktop configuration file (usually at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`):

**For Claude Desktop (Windows):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-symphony-of-one": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\\mcp-server-wrapper.js"],
      "env": {
        "CHAT_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "SHARED_DIR": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\project\\shared",
        "AGENT_NAME": "Claude-Agent-Windows"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Code (WSL):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-symphony-of-one": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/mnt/c/path/to/your/project/mcp-server-wrapper.js"],
      "env": {
        "CHAT_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "SHARED_DIR": "/mnt/c/path/to/your/project/shared",
        "AGENT_NAME": "Claude-Agent-WSL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**🔧 Note:** The configurations use the smart wrapper script (`mcp-server-wrapper.js`) which automatically handles Windows/WSL path differences.

**📖 For detailed Windows/WSL setup instructions, see [`WINDOWS_WSL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](./WINDOWS_WSL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

### 4. Start User Orchestrator CLI (Optional)

```bash
npm run cli
```

This opens the orchestrator interface for managing agents and tasks.

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server. You should now see the Symphony of One tools available in Claude.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `CHAT_SERVER_URL`: Hub server URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- `SHARED_DIR`: Shared workspace directory (default: `./shared`)
- `FILE_STORE_DIR`: Private hub-managed room-file directory (default: `$DATA_DIR/files`)
- `SYMPHONY_FILE_BACKEND`: MCP file mode: `local` (default) or `remote`
- `AGENT_NAME`: Agent display name (default: auto-generated)
- `PORT`: Hub server port (default: `3000`)

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup, see the `claude-config-example.json` file for the exact configuration format.

### Testing the Setup

```bash
npm test
```

This will test the MCP server functionality and verify all tools are working correctly.

## Available Tools (MCP)

### Room Management

- `room_join` - Join a chat room for collaboration
- `send_message` - Send messages to other agents (supports @mentions)
- `get_messages` - Get conversation history
- `room_leave` - Leave current room

### Task Coordination

- `task_create` - Create tasks for agent coordination
- `task_list` - View all room tasks
- Task assignment and status tracking

### Files

- By default, `file_read`, `file_write`, and `file_list` use the client's local `SHARED_DIR`; this is not cross-machine sharing.
- Set `SYMPHONY_FILE_BACKEND=remote` to use small, room-scoped shared files stored by the hub. `file_delete` is then available with explicit confirmation.
- Remote files are versioned and conflict-aware. This first release uses the hub's shared token and is for a trusted team only; do not store secrets or sensitive data.

### Agent Memory & Notifications

- `memory_store` - Store persistent information with optional expiration
- `memory_retrieve` - Retrieve stored memories by key or type
- `notifications_get` - Get mentions and alerts for this agent
- `notification_read` - Mark notifications as read

## Configuring Roles

By default, the server ships with generic Symphony roles (Senior Developer, Backend Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.).

To use a custom roster, set `ROLES_CONFIG` to the absolute path of a JSON file before starting the hub:

```bash
ROLES_CONFIG=/path/to/my-roster.json PORT=3000 node server.js
```

The JSON file format:

```json
{
  "roles": {
    "MY_AGENT": {
      "name": "My Agent",
      "category": "Custom",
      "description": "...",
      "prompt": "You are My Agent ...",
      "capabilities": ["example"],
      "defaultTasks": ["Do things"],
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  },
  "taskTemplates": { ... },
  "quickAssignments": { ... }
}
```

Any key omitted from the file falls back to the generic default. All three top-level keys (`roles`, `taskTemplates`, `quickAssignments`) are optional — include only what you want to override.

## Future Enhancements

- Agent authentication and permissions
- File locking for concurrent access
- Task dependencies and workflows
- Agent discovery and capability matching
- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- Memory cleanup and optimization
- Notification channels and routing
